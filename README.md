# RegenSolar ( DePin Network with Ecological benefits )

RegenSolar introduces an innovative ecosystem to accelerate the adoption and generation of renewable energy. With the GenSensor technology, individuals can attach smart sensors to their green energy sources, like solar panels, to track and convert energy production into digital tokens. This mechanism not only encourages renewable energy generation but also allows for the creation and trade of green energy certificates in our marketplace, promoting transparency and economic activity within the green energy sector. Addressing real-world problems, our project directly contributes to reducing the global carbon footprint by providing economic incentives for clean energy usage, thereby making green energy more financially attractive and accessible. Ultimately, our initiative empowers individuals to actively participate in a sustainable energy future, bridging the gap between renewable energy producers and consumers, and fostering a community committed to environmental stewardship.

# decentralized weather API Integration
- We are first fetching all the devices, then with the help of latitude and longitude, finding the nearest one. Then, we're fetching weather data from that particular local weather station. We are particularly interested in solar irradiance to help us calculate the valid maximum energy that could be generated by a solar panel. Based on that, we judge if our local sensors are tampered with to get an unfair number of tokens. We also reward users that submit their sensor's data along with nearby decentralized weather API device's data.

# Key Features
